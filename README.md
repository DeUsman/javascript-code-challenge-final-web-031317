# JavaScript Code Challenge

## Objectives

+ Constructors / Prototypes or ES6 Classes
+ Callbacks
+ DOM Manipulation

## Instructions

Today we're going to build out an image-sharing application called "Instantgram". Users will provide an image URL and a caption in a form. When the form is submitted, we should append that image into the DOM.

## Deliverables

Build out the feature so that it functions in accordance with the video above. Do your best to follow best practices/separation of concerns. Above all else, get it working.

## Notes

The jQuery library is included for you if you'd like to use it. You may not use any other JavaScript libraries.
